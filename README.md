Git is Awesome!
This repository contains a single file helloWorld.py with the following Python code:

print("Git is Awesome!")

This code simply prints the message "Git is Awesome!" to the console.

This repository is a demonstration of the power and simplicity of Git. With just a few simple commands, you can create a repository, add a file, make changes to that file, and push those changes to a remote repository on GitHub.

If you're new to Git, I encourage you to experiment with this repository. Clone the repository to your local machine, make changes to the code, and push those changes back to the remote repository. See how Git tracks changes and makes it easy to collaborate with others.

Happy coding!
